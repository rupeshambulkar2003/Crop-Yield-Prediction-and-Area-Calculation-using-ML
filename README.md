## Project Overview

The *Crop Yield Prediction and Area Calculation* project is designed to predict crop yields using machine learning algorithms and calculate the area of a single crop based on root length estimation. This project serves as a valuable tool for optimizing crop management and maximizing yield, particularly in areas affected by changing climate and agricultural practices.

## Features

- **Predict Crop Yield:** Uses advanced machine learning models (XGBoost and Random Forest) to predict crop yield based on environmental and crop-specific data.
- **Calculate Crop Area:** Predicts crop root length and uses it to estimate the area covered by a single crop.
- **User Interface:** A web-based interface built with Flask and JavaScript for seamless interaction and easy visualization of predictions.
- **Scalable Workflow:** The project includes modular code and a clean workflow that can be adapted for multiple crop types and growing conditions.

## Data Collection

The project relies on high-quality data to produce accurate predictions. The following data sources and parameters are typically required:

- **Crop Data:** Historical crop yield records, plant density, and crop types.
- **Environmental Data:** Weather patterns, soil quality, temperature, and humidity.
- **Image Data (if applicable):** For estimating root length and calculating area.

Data is gathered from multiple open sources, as well as through field sampling and surveys when required.

## Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed for compatibility with the model.
2. **Model Selection:** XGBoost and Random Forest models were chosen for their high performance in regression tasks.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** The models are trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
  
Each modelâ€™s performance is assessed, and hyperparameters are tuned to improve accuracy.

## Area Calculation

The area of a crop is estimated by predicting the root length. This involves:

1. **Root Length Prediction:** Using a machine learning model trained on image data or field measurements to estimate the root length.
2. **Area Estimation:** Using a formula or model based on the root length to calculate the approximate area occupied by a single crop plant.

## Web Interface

A simple yet functional web interface is developed using Flask and JavaScript to allow users to input crop data and receive predictions in real time. The interface supports:

- **Data Input:** Uploading crop and environmental data.
- **Prediction Results:** Displaying yield predictions and area calculations in a user-friendly format.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Visualizing trends and results for easier interpretation.

To start the web interface, run the `app.py` file and open the provided local server link in your browser.

## Results and Analysis

The project has shown promising results in predicting yield and estimating crop area. Here are some key findings:

- **Yield Prediction Accuracy:** XGBoost provides a high accuracy for yield prediction with an RMSE of around `97.67` on the test data.
- **Area Estimation Accuracy:** The root length-based area calculation method aligns well with actual field measurements and helps to calculate area of the single crop.
  
Further analysis can help improve these predictions and enhance model robustness.
